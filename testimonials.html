            Jo has helped me incredibly on my core strength, 
            with each session structured to build on my
            improving fitness.The exercises tend to be the 
            ones which need greater motivation than when
            training alone. As a result of a strong core, my
            triathlon times have improved significantly, with
            less injuries.</p>

                Over the years - like everybody, I have tried various 
                fitness regimes & diets - but I have to say that 
                since teaming up with Jo it has proved to be a 
                pivotal moment in my life. Jo is vivacious, friendly, 
                supportive, motivational & inspirational - in fact it's 
                hard to say a bad word about her! She has had a 
                big impact on me - not only has she helped change 
                my bodyshape & weight, but she has brought back 
                the feel good factor too.<br> 
                Jo's healthy recipe suggestions have re-educated 
                my tastebuds developing a new healthier style of 
                eating - plus I can still have/enjoy those odd 
                "naughty" days/times & still stay trim! I couldn't 
                recommend her highly enough - she is a star!</p>

            Being a women in her late fifties who was grossly 
            overweight and extremely unfit, I decided it was 
            time to lose weight. Jo has been inspirational 
            with her ongoing support with my diet and mind 
            set which has been paramount to my weight loss, and 
            more importantly to me, my shape change and 
            fitness.</p>

             I began my lifestyle change in January 2013
             resulting in weight loss of  just over three stone. 
             Without Jo' encouragement, excellent support,
             exercise and diet plan I would not have achieved
             this. Thanks Jo.</p>

             Jo has been highly motivational, supportive, encouraging and set personal challenges along the way.
              I would recommend Jo to anyone and my results speak for themselves!</p>
