            in readiness for yet another race.    Thankfully, those days are gone, and Gloucester Running Club is more diverse, both in terms of the ability of our runners, 
            but also in their attitude to running.If you would like to improve    your running and get fit then come join us for a run workout with other people at the same 
            level. Ideal for absolute beginners, right through to people wanting to give themselves more of a challenge.</p>
